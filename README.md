I See You is an Internet Of Things (IoT) based health project used to track the patient’s health status along with the capability of
caregivers to take care of their elder ones through our mobile application and a physical pillbox (hardware box) that’s to be put
at patients’ homes and the box is to be synchronized automatically once the patient took/didn’t take his medications.
